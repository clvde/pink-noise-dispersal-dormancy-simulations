# pink-noise-dispersal-dormancy-simulations

This repo contains all files for my Dissertation Chapter 4 project looking at how different temporal "noise colors" (mostly pink noise) impacts the joint evolution of dispersal and dormancy. 

Files:

(1) Simulation Loop: Newest version is ("simulation_draft_012022.R")
(2) reproduction_functions.R: contains all functions required for individuals in the simulation to reproduce!
(3) patch_distance_calculator.R: contains a function to calculate all pairwise distances among patches in the simulation lattice
(4) env_quality_competition_functions.R: contains all functions required for environmental quality, patch carrying capacities, and competition
(5) colored_time_series_generator.R: contains functions for generating the patch quality values through time for different noise types (colors).
(6) other_functions.R: older file - no longer relevant for the simulation loop.
